Requirement was changed and now we want to enable PersonRepo class to hold both types Student and Staff. Provide a modified  implementation to reflect this change. 

public class PersonRepo { 
  HashMap<
 private List<Staff> staffs = new ArrayList<>(); 
 public void addStaff(Staff s){ 
 staffs.add(s); 
 }
