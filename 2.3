Looking back at implementation of the different ItemRepo methods; Is Set best collection type to be used in terms of performance? Or  we have a better alternative collection type?
Solution :-
 We could have used HashMap<Integer,String> as we are storing unique items only.
 This would avoid overriding efforts and would manage the requirement automatically.
