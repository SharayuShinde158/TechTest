Given the following query, how could it be optimized? List all assumptions: 
select c.* FROM companies AS c 
JOIN users AS u USING(companyid) 
JOIN jobs AS j USING(userid) 
JOIN  useraccounts AS ua USING(userid) 
WHERE j.jobid = 123; 

Solution 
Create index on userid and companyid
Alternative:-
Antijoin

select c.* 
FROM companies AS c 
WHERE EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM users AS u 
  JOIN jobs AS j USING(userid) 
  JOIN useraccounts AS ua USING(userid)
  WHERE u.companyid = c.companyid
    AND j.jobid = 123
) 
;
